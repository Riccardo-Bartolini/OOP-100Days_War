## 📖 About

**100 Days War** is a simplified, single-player strategy game where the player competes against an AI bot on a procedurally generated map. Each match spans **100 virtual days** — every day is simulated within a few seconds — and the goal is to conquer the opponent's spawn cell or control the most territory by the end of the war.

> **University Project** — Developed as part of the *Object-Oriented Programming* course (A.Y. 2023/2024) at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/).
> **Bachelor Degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/laurea/IngegneriaScienzeInformatiche)**.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **🏁 Launch** — Enter a username, then choose to start a new game or load a previous save.
2. **🗺️ Map Generation** — A procedurally generated grid assigns spawn cells to the player and the bot.
3. **📅 Day Cycle** — The game runs for up to 100 days. If a player doesn't make a move for **4 consecutive days**, the turn automatically passes.
4. **💰 Economy** — Earn coins each turn to buy, place, or upgrade units.
5. **🛡️ Defense** — Build **defensive towers** (up to level 4) to protect your territory.
6. **⚔️ Offense** — Deploy and move **soldiers** (up to level 3) across the map.
7. **🎲 Combat** — When a soldier enters an enemy-occupied cell, combat is resolved via a **dice-roll system** scaled by each unit's level. Highest total wins.
8. **🏆 Victory** — Capture the opponent's spawn cell for an early win, or hold the most cells after 100 days.
